# ES6 `let` and `const`

This assignment is designed to introduce you to some features in [ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/), otherwise known as ES6. From this point on, you are expected to use these features.

## Overview: Variable declarations 

- **`let`**
	- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
	- [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#feat=let)
- **`const`**
	- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
	- [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#feat=const)

You are familiar with the process of declaring a variable using `var`, and how that variable receives global or local scope depending on the context in which it was declared. If the variable is declared outside of any functions, it has global scope, but if it is declared inside a function, the variable is scoped to that function and not accessible globally.

With `let`, a variable declaration can be scoped to a code block `{ code }`, such as we commonly see with `for`,  `if`, or `while` constructions. As with variables declared with `var`, the values assigned to them can be reassigned to any type of value at any time, so long as the reassignment occurs within the same scope in which the variable was declared.

`const` is a little more complicated:

- Like `let`, `const` is also block-scoped.
- Variables initialized with `const` must be assigned a value at the time they are declared.
- Unlike variables declared with `var`, variables declared with `const` do not become properties of the `window` object.
- When `const` is used to assign to a variable one of the five primitive values in JavaScript (number, string, Boolean, null, undefined), the variable cannot be reassigned and attempting to do so will throw an error: "Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable."
- However, when a `const` variable is used to hold an object (and by extension arrays and functions, which are both objects in JavaScript), new properties can be assigned to the object and their values reassigned at will.

### Code Demo

1. See the adjacent `demo` folder to compare examples of variable declaration using `let` and `const` with the notation you have been using previously. To work through the examples, open `let-const.html` in the browser, open your developer console, and follow the directions on the screen.
1. Once you complete the steps in the `let-const.html` file, you are ready to move on to the `starter-code` folder.

## Assignment Tasks

Follow these instructions carefully and in order.

1. Work on your fork on a non-master branch. As you work, remember to add, commit, and push regularly.
1. Create a new branch for this assignment called `class-00-lab-a`
1. Make a copy of the starter-code folder named `lab`. Do you work in this folder.
1. Open the `index.html` file in the browser to ensure that it works.
1. In the `js/app.js` file, turn every single `var` variable declarations into `let`.
1. After you do, there will be one error. Find that line in the code, delete that line and respond to the adjacent TODO task.
1. Return to the browser and ensure that the code works again.
1. Now, in the code, convert each `let` variable declarations into `const`.
1. Several bugs will occur. Debug one at a time by using the error messages in the browser console as guidance, turning `const` declarations back into `let` where necessary. Expect there to be some back-and-forth between your code editor and your browser.
1. When you think you have things working, clear local storage and reload the page to ensure that the code still works when starting from a totally clean state.
1. As a refresher on template literal notation, find all concatenations in the code and convert them into template literal notation.
1. Reload the browser to ensure that the code works as expected.

## Submission Instructions

1. When finished, push your branch back to your fork on GitHub, and merge it into master. 
1. Submit a link to your PR. You can link to a pull request even if the pull request is already merged or closed.
1. Add a comment in your Canvas assignment which includes the following:
    - A question within the context of today's lab assignment
    - An observation about the lab assignment, or related 'Ah-hah!' moment
    - How long you spent working on this assignment
